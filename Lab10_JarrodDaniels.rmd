Below is a graph containing all the coordinate information. We are able to now see cases for individual counties in the US allowing us to see many more points.

```{r worldConfirmedCases, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
daily_report <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/03-31-2020.csv")) %>% 
  rename(Long = "Long_") 
    
ggplot(daily_report, aes(x = Long, y = Lat, size = Confirmed/1000)) +
    borders("world", colour = NA, fill = "grey90") +
    theme_bw() +
    geom_point(shape = 21, color='purple', fill='purple', alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(title = 'World COVID-19 Confirmed cases',x = '', y = '',
        size="Cases (x1000))") +
    theme(legend.position = "right") +
    coord_fixed(ratio=1.5)
```

Next we can zoom in on the US (filtering out Alaska and Hawaii). Entries with lat/long of 0 have also been disregarded
```{r USConfirmedZoom, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
daily_report <-   read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/03-27-2020.csv")) %>% 
  rename(Long = "Long_") %>% 
  filter(Country_Region == "US") %>% 
  filter (!Province_State %in% c("Alaska","Hawaii", "American Samoa",
                  "Puerto Rico","Northern Mariana Islands", 
                  "Virgin Islands", "Recovered", "Guam", "Grand Princess",
                  "District of Columbia", "Diamond Princess")) %>% 
  filter(Lat > 0)

ggplot(daily_report, aes(x = Long, y = Lat, size = Confirmed/1000)) +
    borders("state", colour = "black", fill = "grey90") +
    theme_bw() +
    geom_point(shape = 21, color='purple', fill='purple', alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(title = 'COVID-19 Confirmed Cases in the US', x = '', y = '',
        size="Cases (x1000))") +
    theme(legend.position = "right") +
    coord_fixed(ratio=1.5)
```

By using different methods and color palettes we can create different versions of the graph above

```{r USConfirmedDots, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
mybreaks <- c(1, 100, 1000, 10000, 10000)

ggplot(daily_report, aes(x = Long, y = Lat, size = Confirmed)) +
    borders("state", colour = "white", fill = "grey90") +
    geom_point(aes(x=Long, y=Lat, size=Confirmed, color=Confirmed),stroke=F, alpha=0.7) +
    scale_size_continuous(name="Cases", trans="log", range=c(1,7), 
                        breaks=mybreaks, labels = c("1-99",
                        "100-999", "1,000-9,999", "10,000-99,999", "50,000+")) +
    scale_color_viridis_c(option="viridis",name="Cases",
                        trans="log", breaks=mybreaks, labels = c("1-99",
                        "100-999", "1,000-9,999", "10,000-99,999", "50,000+"))  +
# Cleaning up the graph
  
  theme_void() + 
    guides( colour = guide_legend()) +
    labs(title = "COVID-19 Confirmed Cases in the US'") +
    theme(
      legend.position = "bottom",
      text = element_text(color = "#22211d"),
      plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#ffffff", color = NA), 
      panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#ffffff", color = NA), 
      legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#ffffff", color = NA)
    ) +
    coord_fixed(ratio=1.5)
```
 
## Mapping data to shapes

```{r USShapeBlue, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
daily_report <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/03-27-2020.csv")) %>% 
  rename(Long = "Long_") %>% 
  filter(Country_Region == "US") %>% 
  group_by(Province_State) %>% 
  summarize(Confirmed = sum(Confirmed)) %>% 
  mutate(Province_State = tolower(Province_State))

# load the US map data
us <- map_data("state")
# We need to join the us map data with our daily report to make one data frame/tibble
state_join <- left_join(us, daily_report, by = c("region" = "Province_State"))

# plot state map
ggplot(data = us, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) + 
# Add data layer
  geom_polygon(data = state_join, aes(fill = Confirmed), color = "white") +
  geom_polygon(color = "black", fill = NA) +
  scale_fill_gradient(trans = "log10") +
  labs(title = "COVID-19 Confirmed Cases in the US'")
```

there are many R color palettes to choose from or you can create your own. In the above a simple gradient is used. The example from Anisa Dhana uses the viridis palatte which is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of colour blindness. Here is an example using a different color package - Wes Anderson. …and more

```{r USMap WesPallete, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# plot state map
ggplot(data = us, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) + 
# Add data layer
  geom_polygon(data = state_join, aes(fill = Confirmed), color = "white") +
  geom_polygon(color = "black", fill = NA) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = 
                         wes_palette("Zissou1", 100, type = "continuous"),
                         trans = "log10") +
  labs(title = "COVID-19 Confirmed Cases in the US'")

```

If we only look at Massachusetts only
```{r MassAnderson, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
daily_report <-   read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/03-27-2020.csv")) %>% 
  rename(Long = "Long_") %>% 
  filter(Province_State == "Massachusetts") %>% 
  group_by(Admin2) %>% 
  summarize(Confirmed = sum(Confirmed)) %>% 
  mutate(Admin2 = tolower(Admin2))

us <- map_data("state")
ma_us <- subset(us, region == "massachusetts")
counties <- map_data("county")
ma_county <- subset(counties, region == "massachusetts")

state_join <- left_join(ma_county, daily_report, by = c("subregion" = "Admin2")) 

# plot state map
ggplot(data = ma_county, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) + 
# Add data layer
  geom_polygon(data = state_join, aes(fill = Confirmed), color = "white") +
    scale_fill_gradientn(colours = 
                         wes_palette("Zissou1", 100, type = "continuous"),
                         trans = "log10") +
  labs(title = "COVID-19 Confirmed Cases in Massachusetts'")
```
* Note the cases on Nantucket and Dukes counties were reported as one value and not included on the graph. There is also an asssigned category that includes 303 Confirmed cases as of 3/31/2020.

```{r dailyReport, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

```

## Inreractive graphs

Early in the semester, plotly was introduced. It provides us with a way to make interactive grpahs
```{r Interactive map mass, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)

ggplotly(
  ggplot(data = ma_county, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) + 
# Add data layer
  geom_polygon(data = state_join, aes(fill = Confirmed), color = "black") +
    scale_fill_gradientn(colours = 
                         wes_palette("Zissou1", 100, type = "continuous")) +
  ggtitle("COVID-19 Cases in MA") +
# Cleaning up the graph
  labs(x=NULL, y=NULL) +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())
)
```

## Animated Graphs with gganimate

Animated graphs when down right have a great visual impact. You can do this in R and have your animations embedded on your web page. Essentially gganimate creates a series of files that are encompassed in a gif file. In addition to having this gif as part of your report file, you can save the gif and use in a slide or other presentations. It just takes a few lines of code to covert and existing ggplot graph into an animation. 

### Preparing the time series data
The time series data is ripe for animation but first we need to get and format the files
```{r timeSeriesPrep, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
time_series_confirmed_long <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv")) %>%
  rename(Province_State = "Province/State", Country_Region = "Country/Region")  %>% 
               pivot_longer(-c(Province_State, Country_Region, Lat, Long),
                            names_to = "Date", values_to = "Confirmed") 

# Let's get the times series data for deaths

time_series_deaths_long <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv")) %>%
  rename(Province_State = "Province/State", Country_Region = "Country/Region")  %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(Province_State, Country_Region, Lat, Long),
               names_to = "Date", values_to = "Deaths")

time_series_recovered_long <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv")) %>%
  rename(Province_State = "Province/State", Country_Region = "Country/Region") %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(Province_State, Country_Region, Lat, Long),
               names_to = "Date", values_to = "Recovered")

# Create Keys 

time_series_confirmed_long <- time_series_confirmed_long %>% 
  unite(Key, Province_State, Country_Region, Date, sep = ".", remove = FALSE)

time_series_deaths_long <- time_series_deaths_long %>% 
  unite(Key, Province_State, Country_Region, Date, sep = ".") %>% 
  select(Key, Deaths)

time_series_recovered_long <- time_series_recovered_long %>% 
  unite(Key, Province_State, Country_Region, Date, sep = ".") %>% 
  select(Key, Recovered)

# Join tables
time_series_long_joined <- full_join(time_series_confirmed_long,
              time_series_deaths_long, by = c("Key"))

time_series_long_joined <- full_join(time_series_long_joined,
              time_series_recovered_long, by = c("Key")) %>% 
    select(-Key)

# Reformat the data
time_series_long_joined$Date <- mdy(time_series_long_joined$Date)

# Create Report table with counts
time_series_long_joined_counts <- time_series_long_joined %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(Province_State, Country_Region, Lat, Long, Date),
               names_to = "Report_Type", values_to = "Counts")
```

## Creating animations
Below are the packages I installed. There may be others that you need, in particular to rendering gifs. Some of the example may take several minutes to create the animation.

```{r libraries2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
library(transformr)
library(gifski)
library(av)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

An animation of the confirmed cases in select countries

```{r animationCasesUS, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data_time <- time_series_long_joined %>% 
    group_by(Country_Region,Date) %>% 
    summarise_at(c("Confirmed", "Deaths", "Recovered"), sum) %>% 
    filter (Country_Region %in% c("China","Korea, South","Japan","US")) 

p <- ggplot(data_time, aes(x = Date,  y = Confirmed, color = Country_Region)) + 
      geom_point() +
      geom_line() +
      ggtitle("Confirmed COVID-19 Cases") +
      geom_point(aes(group = seq_along(Date))) +
      transition_reveal(Date) 
    
animate(p,renderer = gifski_renderer(), end_pause = 15)

```

Animation for Prof. Chris Sunderland’s example
```{r ChrisSunderlandExample, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
covid <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv")) %>%
           rename(Province_State= "Province/State", Country_Region = "Country/Region") %>%
           pivot_longer(-c(Province_State, Country_Region, Lat, Long),
                  names_to = "Date", values_to = "Confirmed") %>%
           mutate(Date = mdy(Date) - days(1),
                  Place = paste(Lat,Long,sep="_")) %>%
# Summarizes state and province information
             group_by(Place,Date) %>%
           summarise(cumulative_cases = ifelse(sum(Confirmed)>0,
                     sum(Confirmed),NA_real_),
                     Lat = mean(Lat),
                     Long = mean(Long)) %>%
           mutate(Pandemic_day = as.numeric(Date - min(Date)))

world <- ggplot(covid,aes(x = Long, y = Lat, size = cumulative_cases/1000)) +
                 borders("world", colour = "gray50", fill = "grey90") +
                 theme_bw() +
                 geom_point(color='purple', alpha = .5) +
                 labs(title = 'Pandemic Day: {frame}',x = '', y = '',
                      size="Cases (x1000))") +
                 theme(legend.position = "right") +
                 coord_fixed(ratio=1.3)+
                 transition_time(Date) +
                 enter_fade()

animate(world, renderer = gifski_renderer(), end_pause = 30)
```

# Exercise / Lab Report

As of April 3rd, 2020 ther is over 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world.
A visualization of the spread of these cases around the world can be seen in **FIG1.**

```{r Figure1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
daily_report2 <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/03-31-2020.csv")) %>% 
  rename(Long = "Long_")

daily_report3 = daily_report2 %>%
  filter(Country_Region == "US") %>%
  filter(Province_State != "Alaska" || Province_State != "Hawaii")

sumConfirmedUS = sum(daily_report3$Confirmed)

world2 <- map_data("world")
world2$region[world2$region == 'USA'] <- "US"
daily_report2 = daily_report2 %>%
  filter(Province_State != "Alaska" || Province_State != "Hawaii")
daily_report2$Confirmed[daily_report2$Country_Region == "US"] <- sumConfirmedUS

world_join <- left_join(world2, daily_report2, by = c("region" = "Country_Region"))

ggplot(data = world2, mapping = aes(x=long, y=lat, group = group))+
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  geom_polygon(data = world_join, aes(fill = Confirmed), color = "white") +
  geom_polygon(color = "black", fill = NA) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = 
                        wes_palette("Darjeeling1", 100, type = "continuous"),
                        trans = "log10") +
  labs(title = "COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Around the World")
```
**Figure 1** General distribution of COVID-19 around the world by country. Confirmed refers the log10 transformation of confirmed cases by country to get a better idea the actual distribution rather than simple raw numbers.


Based upon reports, the confirmed number of cases of COVID-19 in China, where the virus first appeared have semmingly flat lined (that is the curve has plateaued meaning the amount of confirmed cases is not showing any more significant increases).
While there has been much debate recenly around the accuracy of this infromation, it would suggest that the virus has run its complete course through the country. To get a better idea of this, we can take a look at **FIG2** which provides us with a time lapse of how the total number of cases for the country of China. This could possibly be helful as it might give us an idea of how the virus will affect other countries around the world. Specifically, I believe it could be used to project numbers on confirmed cases as well as lethality of the virus and how long it takes patients to recover.

```{r Figure 2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
date_time2 <- time_series_long_joined_counts %>% 
  group_by(Country_Region, Report_Type, Date) %>% 
  summarise(Counts = sum(Counts)) %>% 
  filter (Country_Region == "China")

p2 <- ggplot(date_time2, aes(x = Date,  y = Counts, color = Report_Type)) + 
      geom_point() +
      geom_line() +
      ggtitle("Confirmed COVID-19 Reports in China") +
      geom_point(aes(group = seq_along(Date))) +
      transition_reveal(Date) 
    
animate(p2,renderer = gifski_renderer(), end_pause = 15)
```
**Figure 2** Time series graph of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered COVID-19 cases in China.

One of the explanations for such a drastic flattening of the curve in COVID-19 cases can be attributed to the mandatory lockdown and shutdown of various cities across the province of Hubei including the epicenter of the virus, Wuhan. This is apparent by looking at **FIG3** below which shows an interactive distribution of the total confirmed cases in China for varying provinces. Due to the nature of the map, all of the provinces included are in their original Mandarin names. As a result **FIG4** can provide a helpful guide to seeing the provinces in their romanized names.

Although most of the cases in China were isolated in the Hubei province, it is also interesting to see the spread of the virus around the provinces over time. This we can see this in **Figure 5** below. While it is already known that the virus originated in the city of Wuhan, this figure clearly shows that as well as how it spread to the surrounding areas of the country since the declaration of the pandemic

**Figure 5** Time lapse of virus spread in China

After looking at the data however, what is interesting is that even though China has the largest population in the world, it is 5th in terms of overall confirmed cases. In fact the countries above them in case numbers are significantly smaller than them in comparison. This disparity can be made more apparent by viewing **Figure 6** Where we can see the timeline of confirmed cases for the 5 countries with the highest number of cases.While there is most certainly a discrepency in the way that numbers for these types of situations gets reported, I believe that this data casts some suspcision on the numbers that are being reported around the world.
```{r Figure 6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
data_time_an <- time_series_long_joined %>% 
    group_by(Country_Region,Date) %>% 
    summarise_at(c("Confirmed", "Deaths", "Recovered"), sum) %>% 
    filter (Country_Region %in% c("US","Italy", "Spain","Germany","China")) 

z <- ggplot(data_time_an, aes(x = Date,  y = Confirmed, color = Country_Region)) + 
      geom_point() +
      geom_line() +
      ggtitle("Confirmed COVID-19 Cases") +
      geom_point(aes(group = seq_along(Date))) +
      transition_reveal(Date) 

z2 <- ggplot(data_time_an, aes(x = Date,  y = Deaths, color = Country_Region)) + 
      geom_point() +
      geom_line() +
      ggtitle("Confirmed COVID-19 Deaths") +
      geom_point(aes(group = seq_along(Date))) +
      transition_reveal(Date)

**Figure 6** Time Series graphs of total cases, deaths, and recoveries for 5 countries with the highest number of cases

Moving on, I wanted to next focus on look at the virus on a much more local scale to see how the virus is taking course in Massachusetts. It is known that the state of Massachusetts expereinced a large spike in cases after a Biogen hosted conference that resulted in a great deal of people becoming infected. As a result of this, we can see that Mass is currently 5th in terms of total confirmed cases even though it is the 15th biggest state in the country. This is apparent by **Figure 6** and as well as **Figure 7**.

```{r Figure 7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(viridis)

daily_reportX <-read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/03-27-2020.csv")) %>% 
  rename(Long = "Long_") %>%
  filter(Country_Region == "US") %>%
  group_by(Province_State) %>%
  summarize(Confirmed = sum(Confirmed)) %>%
  mutate(Province_State = tolower(Province_State))
  
state_join2 <- left_join(us, daily_reportX, by = c("region" = "Province_State"))

ggplotly(
  ggplot(data = us, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) + 
# Add data layer
  geom_polygon(data = state_join2, aes(fill = Confirmed), color = "black") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "red", na.value = NA) +
  ggtitle("COVID-19 Cases Across the US") +
# Cleaning up the graph
  labs(x=NULL, y=NULL) +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank()) 
)

```

  arrange(desc(Confirmed)) %>%
  slice(0:9)
```
**Figure 8** 10 US States with highest confirmed cases of COVID-19

Going even deeper, looking at **Figure 8** which was provided to us by the help of professor Jeffrey Blanchard from the Univeristy of Massachusetts Amherst, we can get a look at how the virus has spread through the individual counties of Massachusetts. It is interesting to note that when looking at the distribution, we can see that Boston (Suffolk County) which is the hub of the state does not even have the most cases, but is in fact Middlesex county.

```{r Figure 9, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplotly(
  ggplot(data = ma_county, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) + 
# Add data layer
  geom_polygon(data = state_join, aes(fill = Confirmed), color = "black") +
    scale_fill_viridis(option="plasma") +
  ggtitle("COVID-19 Cases in MA") +
# Cleaning up the graph
  labs(x=NULL, y=NULL) +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())
)
```

Overall, while it hard to make any defintive observations based upon the data we have been given and the visualizations seen above, it is apparent in the trends the for the United States, there is still a long way to go before the spread of the virus settles down. When comparing data with the countries like China and Japan, it appears that we have failed to stop the spreading the same way they have which should be cause for us to reflect on our internal healthcare system. It also raises eyebrows as to whether or not some of these numbers are correct. This data also did not take into account testing as the US has rapidly began testing more patients as time has gone on. In the future, as more data becomes available, it would be interesting to look into specific types of cases such as looking at asymptomatic carriers, mild cases, and more severe cases. While the above data may not revolutionary it is meant to be an insightful look into the state of the world and some of its countries as we face this new pandemic.
